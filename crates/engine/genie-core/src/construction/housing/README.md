# `construction/housing`: the Housing action

`UNIT_ORDER`'s case 3 gives a building a new Housing (`../../orders/housing_order.rs`). Its start
pays 50 wood straight from the owner's attributes; without the wood it fails (state 13). At work
(state 6) its timer starts at the owner's attribute 62 and runs down by the building's work rate
in every update, less while the building is damaged. Once the timer ran out, the building holds 5
more headroom and its owner gains 5. Its stop gives the cost back in every state, and its
destructor gives it back while it is at work.

- `mod.rs` holds the action's state, its start, its work and its stop.
- `unit.rs` binds it to the building and the world: the install, the update, the headroom and
  the destructor's refund.

## In the game

- `TRIBE_Action_Housing` (action type 0x7b, vtable `0x142ed7008`).
