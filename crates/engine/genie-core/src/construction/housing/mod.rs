//! A building's Housing: `TRIBE_Action_Housing` (action type 0x7b, vtable `0x142ed7008`), which
//! `UNIT_ORDER`'s case 3 installs on a building ([`World::housing_order`]). Its start pays its
//! cost in wood; at work its timer runs down by the building's work rate from its owner's
//! attribute 62; once it ran out the building holds more headroom (attribute 4) and its owner
//! gains as much. Its stop, and its destructor while it is at work, give the cost back.
//!
//! Its slots: the constructor `FUN_140ac1b80`, the load `FUN_140ac1bc0`
//! ([`crate::world::load::top_actions`]), the destructor (slot 0, `0x140ac20f0`,
//! [`HousingAction::refund`]), the start (slot 0x28, `0x140ac2240`), the update (slot 0x30,
//! `0x140ac2a10`, [`crate::objects::unit::Unit::housing_part`]), the stop (slot 0x38,
//! `0x140ac2910`) and `set_state` (slot 0x80, `0x140ac2870`). The save (slot 0x20,
//! `0x140ac24e0`) writes the base and `+0x68`. It holds no target and makes no sub-action.
