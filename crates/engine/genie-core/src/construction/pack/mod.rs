//! A building's Pack: `TRIBE_Action_Pack` (action type 0x7c, vtable `0x142ed7978`), which a
//! trebuchet (class 54) and `UNIT_ORDER`'s case 1 install on a building. At work its timer runs
//! up to its master's pack time (its first train location's time) by the building's work rate,
//! its sprite's frame following it; once it got there, the building turns into its master's
//! transform (`+0x9ba`), its unit AI told to attack its target first. Its destructor before that
//! puts the building's standing sprite and its annexes back.
//!
//! Its slots: the load `FUN_140ad5090` ([`crate::world::load::top_actions`]), the destructor
//! (slot 0, `0x140ad6070` over `FUN_140ad5370`, [`crate::world::World::pack_torn_down`]), the
//! start (slot 0x28, `0x140ad6150`), the update (slot 0x30, `0x140ad69d0`,
//! [`crate::objects::unit::Unit::pack_part`]), the stop (slot 0x38, `0x140ad69b0`,
//! [`PackAction::halt`]) and `set_state` (slot 0x80, `0x140ad68e0`). The save (slot 0x20,
//! `0x140ad6230`) writes the base, `+0x6c`, `+0x68` and `+0x44`. Its other slots are
//! `RGE_Action`'s: its slot 0x68 is the base's change of target (`FUN_140a7a230`), and it makes no
//! sub-action. The object stop reads its progress (`FUN_140ad6170`, [`PackAction::progress`]).
//!
//! `set_state(6)`, which only the list's add (slot 0x28 with 1) runs, is the task
//! pack-set-working's; the constructor (`FUN_140ad4ff0`) and its installs are the task
//! pack-install-work-and-move's: the load is its one maker here.
