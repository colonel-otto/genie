# `world/load/top_actions`: an object's action list

A saved object's action list as the world models it: each action in the list's order, the head
first, with the sub-action it carries.

- `mod.rs` holds the list's load, each action's by its kind, and a saved `MoveTo`'s wait.
- `gathering.rs` holds the gathering actions: the Hunt, the Gather and a farm's Make.
